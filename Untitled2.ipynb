    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the categorical variable has many unique categories, and the cardinality of the variable is not excessively high. For example, if a variable has hundreds of unique categories, one-hot encoding would create too many additional columns, leading to the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "Practical example: Consider a dataset containing a categorical variable \"product_category\" with 50 unique categories. Nominal encoding would assign a unique integer to each category, resulting in 50 different numerical values, which is manageable for most machine learning algorithms. However, using one-hot encoding in this scenario would create 50 additional binary columns, significantly increasing the dimensionality of the dataset."
